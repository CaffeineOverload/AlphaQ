# Emergency App
Have your security in your Pocket.
Due to increase in crime rates and insecurities among citizens, We have tried to provide a simple but efficient solution to tackle this. Our App revolves around a straightforward idea where the user can directly contact helpline authorities and their peers with just a touch or a callouts.

## Challenges we ran into

-Continous Phrase Detection: It was not working as it stops after a 
certain amount of time. We had to loop the Detector to detect
again if it stops.

-Home screen widget: As flutter currently doeesnâ€™t support Home 
Screen widgets, We had to write the code in Java to support 
homescreen widgets

-Calling Emergency Helpline number: The default URL launcher of 
Flutter directed the user to dialer instead of direct calling, so we had
to use a separate package to make the call happen without user
interaction.
 

## What we learned

- Storing preferences offline using shared preferences and syncing it to Firebase Database.
- Creating home screen widgets for Flutter Apps .
- Using Voice Commands in application.
- Creating Dynamic Dark Theme so that it switches in real time.
